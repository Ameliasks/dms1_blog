*Finding Column Grids*

For this activity, I attempted to identify the column grids for [this](https://www.charleskeith.com/au?srsltid=AfmBOooa7l5ob_SVnYjdLcvhHauiGabReKgWjhZOQHXHDU9-eZBC-Al-) website. 

I spoke about creating my column grids in the previous blog post, but I still had to navigate how I was going to utilise this grid in my project. Is 'organised' what I want? Does every text block have to be aligned to the same column?

# :page_with_curl: Assignment 4 Progress

At this stage, I have completed the foundational design for the website. So the layout, typography, images are all pretty much confirmed at this stage. As I go into working on the details and the mobile layout they might be tweaked here and there but I am pleased with how it is going thus far.
