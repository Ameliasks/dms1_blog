## Assignment 3 Playtesting and Feedback

Although my environment was not completed, I still thought it would be good to get some feedback at this stage on the effectiveness of it in various aspects from different players. In this first round of playtesting, these are the results I obtained.

*Results*

Additonally, I did spot some mistakes and technical errors during the playtesting, such as the lack of a collider for the tallest tower, so players got confused when they went through the wall while trying to climb the stairs. I also realised that some assets looked misaligned so I knew I had to rectify that as well.

While playing the games of my classmates, I was amazed at how technically proficient and creative they were. I learnt a lot and was inspired to improve my game.

## Gamification
The idea for players to find the 3 children that I hid in my scene was an idea that struck rather randomly the day before playtesting, so I gave the instructions to my playtesters verbally. I am glad that they seemed to enjoy the little 'game' I included in my environment, so I knew I had to develop a way to display this information within my scene.

My first idea was to try a UI pop-up that appears when the player spawns into the game. But after trying out a few methods shown in tutorials, I could not achieve what I wanted. Thus I decided to make it a physical game object instead.

I played around with the fonts and colours to find the correct contrast and good readibility. I think that this sign serves my intention well so I'm satisfied with it as an alternative!

## General Reflections

This assignment and its accompanying modules was my introduction to Unity. As someone who doesn't play video games, I definitely felt out of my depth the past couple of weeks. In an attempt to make up for this, I spent a lot of time observing 3D forms on Pinterest, watching Unity and Blender tutorials and experimenting all sorts of things in Unity. I also felt a wave of accomplishment and relief as I watched people enjoying my game. I will definitely work on more 3D projects in the future!
