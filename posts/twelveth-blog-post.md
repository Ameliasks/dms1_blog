# :page_with_curl: Classroom Task - Solar System

Today's lesson was my introduction to Unity. I have previously worked with Cinema4D and have dabbled a little in Blender, but despite my knowledge in 3D, each software is so different from one another and it almost feels as if I am re-learning everything everytime to use a new software. Nevertheless, I can't wait to explore the possibilities that Unity can offer. Below are the progress screenshots from my attempt at the classroom task.

*Assigning material to object*

Using [this](https://www2.tntech.edu/leap/astr1010/sssm.html) webpage as reference, I scaled all the planets to size and assigned all of the materials and textures to each planet. However, there were a few unsatifactory elements I needed to rectify in the scene.

First, the lighting was too harsh and many of the planets disappeared into the shadows. To fix this, I changed the directional light to a point light, increased the intensity and moved it further away from the planets. More of the planets can now be seen with the change in lighting. I also used an fx/flare shader for the sun to make it glow.

*Positioning assets*

Next, the positions of the planets. I needed to arrange the planets in such a way that they are properly composed when viewed in game mode and also in the correct order of the solar system.

*Brainstorm session*

Upon reflecting on the most transformative moments of my life, these are the ones I have idenitfied to be in the respective categories.

Big change - When my younger twin siblings came into my life when I was 5. The transition from a pampered single child to an eldest sister came with many responsibilities and lessons, but it was through my siblings that I gained a second childhood- one that I can remember more vividly and fondly than the first. 

Middle change - When my passion for art was re-ignited at 15. While I was in secondary school, I was very lost, I went to school each day with no dreams or goals for the future. It was at this time that I chose to take Art as a subject for my 'O' levels, and started to spend a lot of time and effort on it. Eventually, it grew to become my passion, one I enjoyed doing in and out of school, and led me to consider design as a career and education path. 

Small change - Moving house at 17
When my familly moved to a new home, I was able to have my own room, my own space for the first time in my life. I was also going to a new school, and living in a entirely new neighbourhood. But I would not say it impacted me as much as the previous 2 events.

## Chosen Idea - When my younger twin siblings came into my life when I was 5.

This was the very first idea that came to mind, and I think that further shows how significant this transformation was for me. Although I was very young back then, I can still remember the old house, the spaces we used to play in, and all the toys we shared between the 3 of us. Designing a digital environment around this idea would be comparatively easier than the other options.

*Main list of assets required for the project and key moments of journey*
Nostalgia is the main emotion I want to express in my project. I tried to recall as many items and toys I could from my childhood that I had an emotional connection to. I will try to implement as many of these items as possible.

*Rough sketch of environment layout*

There are 2 environments that I want to build for this project. As the player experiences the path I designed, I hope they will be able to feel the monumental shift of the transformation. 

The first area is supposed to sigify my life as a single child. It is a small, simple indoor area with a sky roof. Beautiful but lonely, and I will make use of a monochromatic colour palette to make the space look dull. As the viewer walks around the 'exhibit' of items, they will encounter a door that will lead them to the second area.

The second area signifies my life after my siblings entered my life. The space is grand and much larger than the first area. The viewer will be immediately met with 6 podium structures, designed with all the different items and toys and I shared with my siblings. Items like the bed and wardrobe would be multiplied, adn new toys would be introduced. The colour palette is bold and colourful. This area is supposed to evoke a sense of wonder and excitement.

*Reference for first area*

I was inspired by the lighting of the environments. Although the colours are not vibrant, the brilliant open ceiling lighting make the scenes very visually appealing. Although the first area is supposed to feel dull and lonely as compared to the second, I still wanted it to exude warmth and beauty and I think it would be amazing if I could replicate something close to these references.

*Reference for second area*

I was inspired by the different podiums in this scene, and it gave me the idea to categorise the objects from the list I prepared, by grouping them on the different podiums.
