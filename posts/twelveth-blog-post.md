# :page_with_curl: Classroom Task - Solar System

Today's lesson was my introduction to Unity. I have previously worked with Cinema4D and have dabbled a little in Blender, but despite my knowledge in 3D, each software is so different from one another and it almost feels as if I am re-learning everything everytime to use a new software. Nevertheless, I can't wait to explore the possibilities that Unity can offer. Below are the progress screenshots from my attempt at the classroom task.

*Assigning material to object*

Using [this](https://www2.tntech.edu/leap/astr1010/sssm.html) webpage as reference, I scaled all the planets to size and assigned all of the materials and textures to each planet. However, there were a few unsatifactory elements I needed to rectify in the scene.

First, the lighting was too harsh and many of the planets disappeared into the shadows. To fix this, I changed the directional light to a point light, increased the intensity and moved it further away from the planets. More of the planets can now be seen with the change in lighting. I also used an fx/flare shader for the sun to make it glow.

*Positioning assets*

Next, the positions of the planets. I needed to arrange the planets in such a way that they are properly composed when viewed in game mode and also in the correct order of the solar system.

*Brainstorm session*

Upon reflecting on the most transformative moments of my life, these are the ones I have idenitfied to be in the respective categories.

Big change - When my younger twin siblings came into my life when I was 5. The transition from a pampered single child to an eldest sister came with many responsibilities and lessons, but it was through my siblings that I gained a second childhood- one that I can remember more vividly and fondly than the first. 

Middle change - When my passion for art was re-ignited at 15. While I was in secondary school, I was very lost, I went to school each day with no dreams or goals for the future. It was at this time that I chose to take Art as a subject for my 'O' levels, and started to spend a lot of time and effort on it. Eventually, it grew to become my passion, one I enjoyed doing in and out of school, and led me to consider design as a career and education path. 

Small change - Moving house at 17
When my familly moved to a new home, I was able to have my own room, my own space for the first time in my life. I was also going to a new school, and living in a entirely new neighbourhood. But I would not say it impacted me as much as the previous 2 events.

## Chosen Idea - When my younger twin siblings came into my life when I was 5.

This was the very first idea that came to mind, and I think that further shows how significant this transformation was for me. Although I was very young back then, I can still remember the old house, the spaces we used to play in, and all the toys we shared between the 3 of us. Designing a digital environment around this idea would be comparatively easier than the other options.
