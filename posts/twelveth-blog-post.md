# :page_with_curl: Classroom Task - Solar System

Today's lesson was my introduction to Unity. I have previously worked with Cinema4D and have dabbled a little in Blender, but despite my knowledge in 3D, each software is so different from one another and it almost feels as if I am re-learning everything everytime to use a new software. Nevertheless, I can't wait to explore the possibilities that Unity can offer. Below are the progress screenshots from my attempt at the classroom task.

*Assigning material to object*

Using [this](https://www2.tntech.edu/leap/astr1010/sssm.html) webpage as reference, I scaled all the planets to size and assigned all of the materials and textures to each planet. However, there were a few unsatifactory elements I needed to rectify in the scene.

First, the lighting was too harsh and many of the planets disappeared into the shadows. To fix this, I changed the directional light to a point light, increased the intensity and moved it further away from the planets. More of the planets can now be seen with the change in lighting. I also used an fx/flare shader for the sun to make it glow.

*Positioning assets*

Next, the positions of the planets. I needed to arrange the planets in such a way that they are properly composed when viewed in game mode and also in the correct order of the solar system.
