*Comparison between sharp and rounded edges*

## Icon Design Process

With the icons previously identified in the previous blog post, I started to transfer the thumbnail drawings into flat design. Off the bat, I knew I wanted my designs to look lively and friendly to suit my concept. As an effort to achieve that look, I experimented with rounded corners in the designs, which I think definately makes the design look 'friendlier' and also more refined.

*Comparison between before and after simplification*

A small struggle I faced after placing my icons together was that some were more detailed than others. In order to strike a balance to achieve overall coherence, I had to remove some details from the original designs.

*icons in progress and colour palette experimentation*

The icons I chose to work on first were: size, security, location and renovation. The style I have chosen is flat colour, rounded edges with subtle block shading. I experimented with a monochromatic, an analogous, a triadic and 2 complementary colour palettes. Overall, I prefer the look of the analogous and complementary palettes, they provide better contrast than monochromatic, and are less chaotic/ busy than the triadic one. They also suit the pleasing, friendly and approachable look I can going for. 

After comparison and deliberation, I have chosen the pink / turquoise complimentary palette. I thought that the contrast and vibrancy of this palette was slightly better than the others and has the approachable and friendly feeling I identified in my concept.

Moving forward, after completing the rest of the icons, I will further rework the colours and contrast of the icons after seeing the whole suite.
