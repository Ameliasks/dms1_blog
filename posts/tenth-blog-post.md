*Using Adobe Audition to edit audio*
For the classroom exercise, Arielle and I went out to record some sounds on our phone, these sounds include stomping, phone pickup/ put down, open/closing door and piano key. Just for the exercise, I used html to include the piano key sound effect on click on the top left icon.

*Brainstorm sketches for interaction icons*

Now with the main 9 icons more or less completed, I needed to get started on the interaction icons that would appear on pointer over. I knew that these icons would need to emphasise the individual messages of the originals. I thought that sparkles could be a nice detail for this set of interaction icons, and that I would retain the main asset from each original icon and change the backgrounds, building upon what I already have. The exception I made to the main asset rule was for 'security', since I had a different idea for that icon.
