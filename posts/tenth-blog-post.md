*Using Adobe Audition to edit audio*

For the classroom exercise, Arielle and I went out to record some sounds on our phone, these sounds include stomping, phone pickup/ put down, open/closing door and piano key. For the exercise, I included the piano key sound effect on click for one of the icons.

## Assignment 2 Progress

*Brainstorm sketches for interaction icons*

Now with the main 9 icons more or less completed, I needed to get started on the interaction icons that would appear on pointer over. I knew that these icons would need to emphasise the individual messages of the originals. I thought that sparkles could be a nice detail for this set of interaction icons, and that I would retain the main asset from each original icon and change the backgrounds, building upon what I already have. The exception I made to the main asset rule was for 'security', since I had a different idea for that icon.

For 'community', since the original icon featured 2 neighbours reaching out to each other, I thought it could be nice to signify community through them hugging in the interaction icon, and I also added 2 more people to further solidify the concept.

For 'appreciation value', since it refers to the increase in the value of a house over time, I thought that the most straightforward way to portray an increase in currency was to use an ascending arrow, akin to the ones seen in sales data and stocks.

For 'security' I wanted to emphasise security measures, and refered back to my old sketches from when I was initially brainstorming for the project. I composed together the assets (keys, shield and pinpad) and from those sketches into the design.

For 'neighbourhood' I used a magnifying glass effect, to show the analysation of a suitable neighbourhood.

For 'size' I wanted to show the different size and forms of a house, to further emphasise 'size' rather than 'expansion', since the original icon could be interpreted in these 2 ways.

For 'location' I wanted to further highlight the message of looking for the right location for a home, since the original logo is a pin and a map, so I slightly altered the icon to feature a house in the location pin. The house in location pin idea was also in one of my early sketches, so that's where I got the idea from.

For 'construction' I zoomed into the blueprint, and turned the hammer and setsquare into a supporting element, to depict the execution of construction plans.

For 'amenities' I swapped the living room background for the addition of more amenities. One of my earlier struggles was picking the best amenity for the original icon, and so I brought back the old ideas back for this design, and composed them (washing machine, bed and fireplace) behind the main element, the sofa, so as to show the different important amenities a home should have.

For 'lifestyle', I wanted to highlight how the car fits into one's lifestyle, so I designed a scene of the car driving against an outdoor backdrop. By retaining the original car element, it also achieves the effect of the car leaving the garage of the house and into the operations of daily life.
