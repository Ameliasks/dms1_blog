## Lighting and Textures

*Sourcing HDRI*

[This](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14268675/CTC-Winter-Olympic-Package) is my lighting and materials reference for this project. I love how the lighting gives a warm glow to the scene, giving a fun yet peaceful atmosphere. I went onto HDRI Haven to source a HDRI that matched this reference. I aim to use a three-point lighting set-up for my scene as I think this will help the render of the scene look more beautiful and professional.

## Sourcing and creating models

I sourced some of my models from SketchFab and inserted them as instances into my scene with the plug-in function. However, since the look that I am going for is stylised, and I have a specific vision for some of the assets I want, I decided to model them on Blender. It has been some time since I last touched Blender, and I had to watch a few tutorials at the beginning to re-familiarise myself with the software. I quickly got used to it and eventually managed to model the assets on my own.

*Editing texture map on Photoshop*

For the assests I procured on SketchFab, I edited their texture maps on Photoshop so as to gain more control over the material finish of the models. I neede to do this because I needed the models to fit into the stylised look I was going for and for them to look harmonious next to ecah other and with the rest of the assets I modelled. I also did some simple modelling on Unity using ProBuilder.

## Increasing affect

As I observed the works of my peers and the works of other 3D artists on Pinterest and Behance, I found my flat terrain to be lacking in affect for the transition. So ameliorate this, I made a couple of changes.
