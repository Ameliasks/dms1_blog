*Adding paths to greybox*

After creating the most basic forms of my project, I realised I needed to add paths to help the user navigate each podium 1 by 1. To achieve this, I used ProBuilder to create ramps. For the regular slope, I adjusted the vertices to combine it into the podium, and for the curved ramps, I used a bezier shape to curve the ramp around the podium, then adjusted the vertices. I used more curved/spiral paths for the second area as I envisioned it to look somewhat like a theme park.With this mix of straight, oblique and spiral paths, I hope that the player will be excited to explore the environment I designed.
