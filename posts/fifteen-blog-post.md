## Lighting and Textures

[This](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14268675/CTC-Winter-Olympic-Package) is my lighting and materials reference for this project. I love how the lighting gives a warm glow to the scene, giving a fun yet peaceful atmosphere. I went onto HDRI Haven to source a HDRI that matched this reference.The reason why I have chosen a sunset HDRI for my scene is because I loved the warmth that it casts upon the scene, further highlighting the beautiful nostalgia of my childhood.

 I aim to use a three-point lighting for my scene as I think this will help the render of the scene look more beautiful and professional. Three-point lighting is a traditional method for illuminating a subject in a scene with light sources from three distinct positions. I will be using a yellow-tinted area light (keylight) to make the scene look warm, and use a less intense white directional light (fill light) adjacent to the keylight to make the assets pop, and finally across from them use a big point light (backlight) to help the main scene stand out from the background.

## Sourcing and creating models

I sourced some of my models from SketchFab and inserted them as instances into my scene with the plug-in function. But because I am going for a stylistic, semi-realistic approach, I was not able to find all my ideal models on SketchFab. Hence, I decided to model some of those that weren't too complicated on Blender and imported them into Unity as .obj files. This gave me good control over materials as well, since the model is fully customisable.

*Editing texture map on Photoshop*

For the assests I procured on SketchFab, I edited their texture maps on Photoshop so as to gain more control over the material finish of the models. I neede to do this because I needed the models to fit into the stylised look I was going for and for them to look harmonious next to each other and with the rest of the assets I modelled. I also did some simple modelling on Unity using ProBuilder. 

These models include:

The stylisation of the assets also applies to the scale. All the objects are not realistically scaled to the perspective of the player or to each other. This is because I wanted to show the subjectivity of a child's perspective. As a child, we most probably perceive and remember certain things differently. For example, watching my DVDs on my TV was what I loved doing most as a young child, thus I scaled the DVDs and TV to be very large. In juxtaposition, the dining table is scaled to be very small, since I have little memory of dinners during my childhood, probably because my mind was preoccupied with the TV. *haha*  So although in real life, the dining table should be muh bigger than the TV, I made it much smaller instead.
