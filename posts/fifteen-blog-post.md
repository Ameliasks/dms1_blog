## Lighting and Textures

*Sourcing HDRI*

[This](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14268675/CTC-Winter-Olympic-Package) is my lighting and materials reference for this project. I love how the lighting gives a warm glow to the scene, giving a fun yet peaceful atmosphere. I went onto HDRI Haven to source a HDRI that matched this reference.The reason why I have vhosen a sunset HDRI for my scene is because I loved the warmth that it casts upon the scene, further highlighting the beautiful nostalgia of my childhood.

 I aim to use a three-point lighting for my scene as I think this will help the render of the scene look more beautiful and professional. Three-point lighting is a traditional method for illuminating a subject in a scene with light sources from three distinct positions.

## Sourcing and creating models

I sourced some of my models from SketchFab and inserted them as instances into my scene with the plug-in function. However, since the look that I am going for is stylised, and I have a specific vision for some of the assets I want, I decided to model them on Blender. It has been some time since I last touched Blender, and I had to watch a few tutorials at the beginning to re-familiarise myself with the software. I quickly got used to it and eventually managed to model the assets on my own.

*Editing texture map on Photoshop*

For the assests I procured on SketchFab, I edited their texture maps on Photoshop so as to gain more control over the material finish of the models. I neede to do this because I needed the models to fit into the stylised look I was going for and for them to look harmonious next to ecah other and with the rest of the assets I modelled. I also did some simple modelling on Unity using ProBuilder. 

These models include:

The stylisation of the assets also applies to the scale. All the objects are not realistically scaled to the perspective of the player or to each other. This is because I wanted to show the subjectivity of a child's perspective. As a child, we most probably perceive and remember certain things differently. For example, watching my DVDs on my TV was what I loved doing most as a young child, thus I scaled the DVDs and TV to be very large. In juxtaposition, the dining table is scaled to be very small, since I have little memory of dinners during my childhood, probably because my mind was preoccupied with the TV. *haha*  So although in real life, the dining table should be muh bigger than the TV, I made it much smaller instead.

## Increasing affect

As I observed the works of my peers and the works of other 3D artists on Pinterest and Behance, I found my flat terrain to be lacking in affect for the transition. So ameliorate this, I made a couple of changes.
