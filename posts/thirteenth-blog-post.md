We used Google maps to get the location and floor that Muji was on while we were in class, and the walked over to Emporium. Upon going up the escalator at the entrance, we immediately spotted the store.

*Rough greybox blocking*

While creating this blocking, I realised that I needed to add more paths so that the environment would be more interactive, especially in the second area.

*Redoing greybox blocking with Unity ProBuilder*

As I was researching how achieve bevel for 3D objects on Unity, I found out about ProBuilder and the essential modelling tools it holds. I downloaded it using the package manager. With this tool, I could adjust the sides and height counts, and by using edge loop, I could select the edges I wanted to bevel and bevel them. I think it helped the models look more refined.
