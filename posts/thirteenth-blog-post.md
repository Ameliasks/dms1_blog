We used Google maps to get the location and floor that Muji was on, and walked towards Emporium. Upon going up the escalator at the entrance, we immediately spotted the store.

*Rough greybox blocking*

While creating this blocking, I realised that I needed to add more paths so that the environment would be more interactive, especially in the second area.

*Redoing greybox blocking with Unity ProBuilder*

As I was researching how achieve bevel for 3D objects on Unity, I found out about ProBuilder and the essential modelling tools it holds. I downloaded it using package manager. With this tool, I could adjust the sides and height counts, and by using edge loop, I could select the edges I wanted to bevel and bevel them. Beveling is a very important detail to me as it  gives a more refined look to the 3D models.
