*Experiment with HDRIs and optical illusions*

For my optical illusion/ anamorphic experiement, I utilised the terrain scene from the last lesson and juxtaposed it with a moon. I wanted to make the moon appear to be very large, but in fact, it is just positioned very close to the camera. 

I wanted to familiar myself with using SkyBox and HDRIs as I know I would need this knowledge on lighting later on in my own project. I also found new grass texture maps, just to see if the lighting effect works on materials with texture.
