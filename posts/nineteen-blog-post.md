*Trying out different fonts and hierachy*

## Typography

As I mentioned in my previous blog post, I really love the bold play of typography of [Angello Torres's](https://angellotorres.com/) website, and played around with a few different fonts and the font hierachy, which I will further shortlist later on. As font combinations can be a little precarious when not executed properly, I will have to make sure that the fonts I ended up choosing will complement each other well.

## Colour Palette

*Trying out colour palettes*

I found a few colour palette references on Pinterest that originated from different forms of design, which have the pop, imaginative and colourful vibe that I am going for.

## Consolidated Text for Website

I have edited and shortened the reflections written in the previous blog post. I chose to omit some details of the processes, and I believed that the website should not be too wordy as it would affect the user experience. Nevertheless, I made sure there was just enough details retained so that the viewer would still be able to grasp the ideas and meanings behind my creative decisions for each project. I also concised the assignment briefs and added them into the website, as I thought it would be good to provide some context into the limitations and considerations of each project.

Text is as follows:

Hi there! I'm Amelia! 
A visual designer and illustrator who’s just begun a new journey studying Digital Media at RMIT University.

I love producing creative work and am passionate about bringing ideas to life through engaging and communicative solutions. 

I greatly value opportunities to learn, grow and evolve and believe that experiences are crucial in shaping one's creative identity and practice.

I am excited to explore more of the expansive realms of digital video and web design moving forward.

Leaving The Nest - Video Production, Video Editing, Adobe Premiere Pro 
Using footage shot on a smartphone, create a video self-portrait that connects a series of places, objects, events, and people, and thus the ideas and meanings that they represent, through simple editing techniques. The portrait can either be reflective or aspirational.

About
This video conveys the disorientation and overwhelming emotions I felt when I first moved to Melbourne, as I moved away from the comfort of my home and family for the first time. It explores the initial feelings of fear and isolation, to melancholy and sadness of being homesick, and finally the feelings of contentment and anticipation for a new beginning.

The emotional tone of the video goes through several shifts, from disorientation to melancholy to contentment. To portray the disorientation of moving to a new city, I used footages of the bustling Melbourne CBD in day time, and used increasing fast cuts to build intensity through pacing.  As the video transitions into the melancholy stage, I utilised footages of the city at night, with long cuts to frame loneliness and longing. And finally, when the video progresses to the contentment stage, I used footage of the city and the river at sunset and used slow transitions to create a beautiful and calm atmosphere.

For the sound design, I used a hollow and haunting soundtrack for the first portion of the video, to exaggerate the feeling disorientation. I also turned up the atmospheric sound from the footages to help the viewers feel immersed into the city, and layered more sound effects as the pacing of the video intensified. For the melancholic part, the soundtrack I picked was gentle and somber, and subdued the atmospheric sound to give way to the phone call monologue. As the video shifts into the conclusion, to reflect contentment and hopefulness, the soundtrack is soft and uplifting and gently fades off at the end.

What’s In A Home? - Icon Design, Adobe Illustrator, Video Studio Code, Adobe Audition
Create a suite of nine unified and responsive graphic icons in a flat design style, arranged on a simple HTML5 webpage. 

About
The concept I had for this project was a real estate website where prospective home buyers could interact with the icons to view the factors they should consider before buying a home. The nine factors were as follows: community, appreciation value, security, neighbourhood, size, location, renovation potential, amenities and lifestyle. I wanted the to website to feel approachable and friendly to my target audience, which would be young new home buyers in their 20s and 30s.

Clarity + Consistency
I chose to work with a pink and cyan complimentary colour palette because of its vibrancy and friendliness, that would likely appeal to my target audience. The main challenge I faced while working on this project was keeping clarity and consistency. I had to find the right balance of detail; too much and the icons would not look like they are in flat 2D style, too little and the message of the icon may be lost. Each icon had to have individuality, while looking like they belong to the same family. Using a colour palette helped significantly as I could utilise it to create contrast within the designs, highlight certain key elements, and unite all the icons. Sound design played a key supporting element to the icons. Each audio had to be clear, coordinated with the visual design, and be of consistent volume.

A Place That Lives In My Mind - 3D Environment, Unity, Video Studio Code, Adobe Audition
Design and produce a navigable 3D digital environment that is based on some kind of meaningful change or transformation that you have undergone. 

About
This environment was based off my childhood memories, depicting my transition from a single child to an older sister when I was five and the second childhood I had gained through younger twin siblings.

“The next best thing to the enjoyment of a good time is the recollection of it.”
In this project, the virtual camera is in the first-person perspective of the player. As the environment was about my childhood, I wanted the environment to feel huge, just like how I saw the world as a young child, and made the decision to make the objects disproportionately big, for the viewers to navigate it with the curiosity and excitement of a child. 

This project was the first one where I had to consider the 360 spatial design, as I was so used to designing in a 2D canvas or frame. I made use of the soundtracks to convey emotional shifts as one journeys across the environment and utilised sound effects to highlight interactions in my environment.

To give the environment a child-like charm, I knew that I want to achieve a pastel and stylised look for this environment. There was certainly a challenge in unifying all the assets, since all the downloadable assets from SketchFab were all created by different people. In order to resolve this, I edited the texture maps of all the assets in Photoshop and replaced them in the material inspector, so as to change the hues and saturation of the original colours. I also modelled some of my own assets on Blender and ProBuilder, to give myself flexibility with the materials.

The first prototype of this project proved to be a great asset in helping me to identify things I needed to improve on through obtaining feedback from play testers.
