# :page_with_curl: Assignment 3 Update

*Environment Progress*

At this stage, I am about 50% done with building the environment. While I am progressing, I realised that the assets I planned in the initial sketch was insufficient to fill this 3D space, and I had to come up with other things I could add to populate the environment, and also give it more detail. Additionally, navigation was mentioned in class so it occured to me that I needed to think about how I might assist players in finding their way around the environment. 

Up till the entrance of the second area, it is a straightforward path, but I would like players to explore the second area as freely as they wish, with the freedom of a child. That being said, I need to test if the 'jump' is high enough, and if not, tweak the code for it to be so that the players would be able to climb the steps as easily as possible. And make sure that there are clear paths to allow smoother navigation, and perhaps even add some signs to suggest possible routes for the players.
