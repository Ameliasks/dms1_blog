# :page_with_curl: Classroom Activity - Wireframing

*Wireframing in Figma*

The site I chose to do a wireframe of is [this](https://www.hellokuya.co/) site that I mentioned in a previous blog post. After referencing the original site, I adjusted the sizes of the boxes to be more accurate, and added the details that I had overlooked. I also made the fixed elements a darker colour to differentiate them from the rest.

*Sketching layouts for my site*

I browsed many different portfolio websites and sketched some of the layouts that I might want to try out in Figma. I then tried them out with sample text and wireframe in the platform.

*Left: Wireframe, Right: Reference*

Through this trial, I decided that I liked the first layout for the project descriptions best. But I liked the variety of type and the use of rounded rectangles of the second one, so I will try to implement that into the design. I also wireframed some variations for the about/landing page as shown below.

*About/Landing Page Wireframes*

After consulting my peers, and doing some personal deliberation, I decided to merge the bottom two designs into a new design. The comments were that those two designs brought out the bold energy of the background colour and were the most visually interesting. I liked the huge pixel typography title of the bottom left design, and the way of laying out personal facts of the second, as breaking the text up is more pleasant for being to read and helps to retain better attention. Shown below is the new developed design.

*Font Combinations and Colours*

Using the layout I had just created, I used it to compare different font combinations and colour palettes, as I was not completely decided yet.

*Palette*

I decided on the yellow combination, but extended the palette so that I can use different colours for different segments of the website, so that the site would not look too monotonous.

*Guide*

I set up a column guide in for my design with a 60px margin and 20px gutter. This column guide will help me keep the design consistent as it develops.

The fonts that I have chosen for the project are Silkscreen (decorative font), Belgrano (subheadings) and Karla (body text). I adjusted the kerning and leading of the typography to enhance legibility.
