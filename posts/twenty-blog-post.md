*Wireframing in Figma*

The site I chose to do a wireframe of is [this](https://www.hellokuya.co/) site that I mentioned in a previous blog post. After referencing the original site, I adjusted the sizes of the boxes to be more accurate, and added the details that I had overlooked. I also made the fixed elements a darker colour to differentiate them from the rest.
