# :page_with_curl: Classroom Activity - Wireframing

*Wireframing in Figma*

The site I chose to do a wireframe of is [this](https://www.hellokuya.co/) site that I mentioned in a previous blog post. After referencing the original site, I adjusted the sizes of the boxes to be more accurate, and added the details that I had overlooked. I also made the fixed elements a darker colour to differentiate them from the rest.

*Sketching layouts for my site*

I browsed many different portfolio websites and sketched some of the layouts that I might want to try out in Figma. I then tried them out with sample text and wireframe in the platform.

*Left: Wireframe, Right: Reference*

Through this trial, I decided that I liked the first layout for the project descriptions best. But I liked the variety of type of the use of rounded rectangles of the second one, so I will try to implement that into the design.

*Font Combinations and Colours*

Using the layout I had just created, I used it to compare different font combinations and colour palettes, as I was not completely decided yet.

*Palette*

I decided on the yellow combination, but extended the palette so that I can use different colours for different segments of the website, so that the site would not look too monotonous.
