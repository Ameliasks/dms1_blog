*In class progress*

Using the icons I have prepared so far, I included the hover-image change, and on-click-audio play interactivity. Definately ran into several problems with the code, usually because of some little mistakes, whether it's directory or spelling errors. But there were also several issues will layout that could not be troubleshooted, so I backtracked until it was working normally and restarted the code.

Now that I can see the overview of the icons, I can see some things that can be improved, such as the visual connection between the image changes. I will refine the shapes and colours to ameliorate this. I also now have a better idea of what audio to use for the individual icons to enhance the message of each icon.
