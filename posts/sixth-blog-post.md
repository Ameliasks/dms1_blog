*Black Square Activity*

## Classroom Task

This task required me to do quick compositions and layouts with a decent amount of variety using Adobe Illustrator. I think it is really amazing how shapes on their own can contribute so much in design, by communicating so different messages even when you make them just subtly different. For order, I retained the size of all the squares, to show repetition and structure. I played around with the sizing and rotation of the squares to use contrast to show 'increase'. For 'bold', I increased the sizes of all the boxes, to reduce the amount of white space, and played around with rotation to express movement. Similarly for 'congested' I wanted to reduce the amount of white space even further, and make the squares look tapped and restrictive in the space. For 'tension' I used a mix of rotation for the squares, and reduced the white space between them to show disharmony. And lastly for 'playful, I tried out different compositions with smaller squares, and utilised white space and rotation to give the illusion of movement. I think it is a great simple activity that encourages creativity and flexbility, since we needed to work within the contraints of 4 black boxes contained by a box in a short time.

## Assignment 2 Brainstorm

*Rough Mindmap on Journal*

I started the defining process by first shortlisting 5 topics that stood out to me: dream, community, movement, home and future. I then did a quick google search on the different aspects of each of the topics. While doing this, I had inspirations for 'dream' and 'home' and so I will be going further in depth with these 2 topics.

For 'dream' I looked into different kinds of dreams, and from an article I found on the healthline website, I pulled [this](https://www.healthline.com/health/types-of-dreams#lucid-dreams) list of different types of dreams: Nightmares, night terrors, lucid dreams, daydreams, recurring dreams, healing dreams, false awakenings, vivid dreams and prophetic dreams. I thought that I could possibly do a bottled dream concept, where each icon looks like a bottle, until you hover over and see one of the types of dreams. But some of these dreams are challenging to express in icon form, so I have to think a little further.

For 'home' I have 2 different approaches in mind, the first would be icons of home furniture like: sofa, lamp, bed, etc. and the second is icons of the emotional needs of a good home. According to [this](https://happiful.com/what-makes-a-happy-home) list, these emotional needs include: security, adaptability, nourishment and self-expression. Additionally, [this](https://victoriarealtors.in/blog/features-ideal-home/#:~:text=An%20ideal%20home%20offers%20it's,the%20entry%20of%20unwanted%20intruders.) includes factors such as: size of house, contruction and architecture, location and connectivity, safety and security, appreciation value, amneties, good neighbourhood and lifestyle. Combining the factors from both articles could be a probable idea for the project.

## Assignment 2 Chosen Concept

After deliberation, the theme I have chosen is 'home'. The platform would be a desktop website, a real estate website that will inform buyers what they should be looking for in a new home. The audience would be people in their mid twenties to thirties, interested in buying a new home and and looking up this website for information. I want to website to feel approachable and friendly to the prospective new home buyers.
