## Classroom Task

*Blacksquares Activity*

This task required me to do quick compositions and layouts with a decent amount of variety using Adobe Illustrator. I think it is really amazing how shapes on their own can contribute so much in design, by communicating so different messages even when you make them just subtly different. I think it is a great simple activity that encourages creativity and flexbility, since we needed to work within the contraints of 4 black boxes contained by a box in a short time.
