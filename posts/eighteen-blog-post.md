# :page_with_curl: Week 10 Session 2 Homework 

The key words I want to be associated with the aesthetic of my webpage, and that I think reflects the style of my works well are: <b>pop, imaginative and colourful.</b>

The target audience I reckon would be prospective employers or anyone who is interested in viewing my work, and I think that they'll appreciate a site that is visually interesting yet easy to navigate. Features that they would probably look out would be an about page that would allow them to get to know me better, a page that explains my work and a page with my contact information.

## Assignment 1 - Video Edit (Leaving The Nest)

This video conveys the disorientation and overwhelming emotions I felt when I first moved to Melbourne, as I moved away from the comfort of my home and family for the first time. It explores the initial feelings of fear and isolation, to melancholy and sadness of being homesick, and finally the feelings of contentment and anticipation for a new beginning.

"And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of new beginnings." is a quote by Meister Eckhart, a German Catholic theologian, philosopher and mystic. I added this quote into the video as I thought it perfectly encapsulated the message of the video.

The emotional tone of the video goes through several shifts, from disorientation to melancholy to contentment. To portray the disorientation of moving to a new city, I used footages of the bustling Melbourne CBD in day time, and used snappy cuts that got faster, to build intensity through pacing. As the video transitions into the melancholy of missing family back at home, I utilized footages of the city at night, with measured cuts of neon signs like seem lonely. And finally, when the video progresses to the contentment stage, I used footage of the city and the river at sunset and used slow transitions, the mix of warm and cool hues portray a beautiful and calm atmosphere that made the video feel like a love letter to myself and to the place I call my new home. 

For the sound design, I used a hollow and haunting soundtrack for the disorientative portion of the video, to exaggerate the feeling of being lost in an unfamilliar place. I also turned up the atmospheric sound from the footages to help the viewers feel immersed into the city, and layered more sound effects as the pacing of the video intensifies. For the melancholic part, the soundtrack I picked was gentle and somber, and subdued the atmospheric sound to give way to the phone call monologue. As the video shifts into the conclusion, to reflect contentment and hopefulness, the soundtrack is soft and uplifting and gently fades off at the end.

The seagull in this video symbolisation of me, and I used it to draw attention to the 3 transformational points of the video: the long establishing shot of a wondering seagull, the shot of 2 seagulls that cues in the final soundtrack after a few beats of silence, and the long ending shot of it flying away. These shots represent being lost in a new city, making friends and the excitement for a new beginning respectively.

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons (What's In A Home?)

The concept I had come up with for the graphic icons project was a real estate website, where prospective home buyers could interact with the icons to view the factors they should consider before buying a home. The nine factors were as follows: community, appreciation value, security, neighbourhood, size, location, construction/ renovation potential, amenities and lifestyle. I wanted the to website to feel approachable and friendly to my target audience, which would be young new home buyers in their 20s and 30s.

After a round of rough thumbnail sketching, I picked the ones I believed best conveyed the individual factors and brought them in Illustrator to digitalize them. It was during this process that I faced the challenge of simplifying my designs. While they needed to be minimalistic, removing certain details could risk removing meaning from it. Another challenge was getting all the icons to look like they are part of the same family. Although using a colour palette helped marginally, but because each of the elements for icons were so different, I had to adjust the shapes and contrast of all the designs while comparing them with each other.  Through a lot of experimentation, I eventually got the icon designs to a point which has both clarity and consistency.

The colour palette I had decided on was a complementary palette of pink and cyan. I chose this palette because of its vibrancy and friendliness, that would appeal to my target audience. I made sure that I had a balance of shades to create contrast within the designs, like the dark maroon and the off-white colours that help provide accents amongst the main bold peach, pink and cyan shades. By keeping to a strict number of colours, the hue and value contrasts were united throughout the whole set of icons.

I knew that for this project, the sound design played a supporting role to the visual design, and that I should take cues from from the designs when I am deciding on their corresponding sound effects, so that the audience can quickly pick up on the message each icon is trying to convey. I was also aware that they should be all of equal volume, like a family, and processed them as such before coding them into the html. 

During the ideation stage for the project, I looked and referenced several icon vector designs I had found on the web. By being exposed to what industry standark icon design work looks like, and how well the designers were able to concise complicated ideas and concepts into minimalistic designs was certainly helpful when I was doing my thumbnail sketches. I started out by sketching the main component of the icon, and from there added supporting elements that I thought would help play up the message it was supposed to convey.

## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment (A Place That Lives In My Memory)

This environment was based off my childhood memories, depicting my transition from a single child to an older sister when I was five and the second childhood I had gained through younger twin siblings. The first prototype of this project proved to be a great asset in helping me to identify things I needed to improve on through obtaining feedback from playtesters. 

During the initial visualisation of the project, I had planned out how I wanted my environment to look like from the front. But this quickly proved to be a huge oversight as I started to work inside Unity. As the viewer has the chance to view the environment in 360 perspective, I realised that I had neglected the sides and back of the terrain, and they were looking awkward and incomplete. I had to brainstorm and ideate again for these portions of the environment.

In this project, the virtual camera is in the first-person perspective of the player. As the environment was about my childhood, I wanted the environment to feel huge, just like how I saw the world as a young child, and made the decision to make the objects disproportionately big, for the viewers to navigate it with the curiousity and excitement of a child.  The video editing project was also done from a first-person perspective as it was shot and edited by me, the world presented through my eyes. I believe that everyone has their own set of experiences that shapes their perspective, so viewers might have different interpretations of my work. But that is what I find so fascinating and fun about creative work is that there is no definitive answers to what it means, but whatever it has allowed you to feel and the thoughts that it incited you to form is what is true.

The sound design for this project was similar to that of the previous two projects in different ways. Similar to the video editing assignment, I made use of the soundtracks to convey emotional shifts as one journeys across the environment. And similar to the graphic icons assignment, I made use of sound effects to highlight interactions in my environment. 

From the beginning, I knew that I want to achieve a pastel and stylised look for this environment. There was certainly a challenge in unifying all the assets, since all the downloadable assets from SketchFab were all created by different people. In order to resolve this, I edited the texture maps of all my assets in Photoshop and replaced them in the material inspector. It is through this process that I was able to change the colours, tones and values of the assets. I also modelled some of my own assets on Blender and ProBuilder, to give myself flexibility with the colours. I had created my own colour palette and a set of materials that I applied onto the assets so they look harmonious against each other. 

## Draft Artist Statement 

Hi there! I'm Amelia Siew, a visual designer and illustrator whose just begun a new journey studying Digital Media at RMIT University. I love producing creative work and am passionate about bringing ideas to life through engaging and communicative solutions. I greatly value opportunities to learn, grow and evolve and believe that experiences are crucial in shaping one's creative idenity and practice. I am excited to explore more of the expansive realms of digital video and web design moving forward.

## Inspirations

[Joonas Sandell's](https://joonassandell.com/) landing page has a layout I can see working for my single-page portfolio. I like how all the elements move as I scroll, and the layering of 2D graphic elements, typography and images is very interesting. The style is bold and creative and I think it'll be cool to put own spin on it.

While making my second portfolio site earlier this year, I chanced upon [Angello Torres's](https://angellotorres.com/) webpage and was blown away. Although my portfolio ended up not looking anything like theirs, I really admire the bold play of colours and typography that somehow exists in harmony with each other and expresses the designer's unique style and creative persona. I aspire to create an experimentive and aesthetic look that's at least half as good as this one.

[KUYA's](https://www.hellokuya.co/) site is modern, chic and well-organised, I wish to reference their fluid animations and strong use of colour.
