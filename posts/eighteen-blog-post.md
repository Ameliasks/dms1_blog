# :page_with_curl: Week 10 Session 2 Homework 

The key words I want to be associated with the aesthetic of my webpage, and that I think reflects the style of my works well are: <b>pop, imaginative and colourful.</b>

The target audience I reckon would be prospective employers or anyone who is interested in viewing my work, and I think that they'll appreciate a site that is visually interesting yet easy to navigate. Features that they would probably look out would be an about page that would allow them to get to know me better, a page that explains my work and a page with my contact information.

## Assignment 1 - Video Edit (Leaving The Nest)

This video conveys the disorientation and overwhelming emotions I felt when I first moved to Melbourne, moving away from the comfort of my home and family for the first time. It explores the initial feelings of fear and isolation, to melancholy and sadness of being homesick, and finally the feelings of contentment and anticipation for a new begining.

"And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of new beginnings." is a quote by Meister Eckhart, a German Catholic theologian, philosopher and mystic. I included this quote because I think it reflects the message of the video perfectly.

The emotional tone of the video goes through several shifts, from disorientation to melancholy to contentment. 

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons (What's In A Home?)

After deliberation, the theme I have chosen is 'home'. The platform would be a desktop website, a real estate website that will inform buyers what they should be looking for in a new home. The audience would be people in their mid twenties to thirties, interested in buying a new home and and looking up this website for information. I want to website to feel approachable and friendly to the prospective new home buyers.

My 9 icons would be as follows: community, appreciation value, security, neighbourhood, size, location, construction/ renovation potential, amenities and lifestyle.



## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment (A Place That Lives In My Memory)

This environment was based off my childhood memories, depicting my transition from a single child to an older sister when I was five and the second childhood I had gained through younger twin siblings. The first prototype of this project proved to be a great asset in helping me to identify things I needed to improve on through obtaining feedback from playtesters. 

In this project, the virtual camera is in the first-person perspective of the player. As the environment was about my childhood, I wanted the environment to feel huge, just like how I saw the world as a young child, and made the decision to make the objects disproportionately big, for the viewers to navigate it with the curiousity and excitement of a child.  The video editing project was also done from a first-person perspective as it was shot and edited by me, the world presented through my eyes. I believe that everyone has their own set of beliefs that shapes their perspective, so viewers might have different interpretations of my work. But that is what I find so fascinating and fun about creative work is that there is no definitive answers to what it means, but whatever it has allowed you to feel and the thoughts that it incited you to form is what is true.

The sound design for this project was similar to that of the previous two projects in different ways. Similar to the video editing assignment, I made use of the soundtracks to convey emotional shifts as one journeys across the environment. And similar to the graphic icons assignment, I made use of sound effects to highlight interactions in my environment. 

From the beginning, I knew that I want to achieve a pastel and stylised look for this environment. There was certainly a challenge in unifying all the assets, since all the downloadable assets from SketchFab were all created by different people. In order to resolve this, I edited the texture maps of all my assets in Photoshop and replaced them in the material inspector. It is through this process that I was able to change the colours, tones and values of the assets. I also modelled some of my own assets on Blender and ProBuilder, to give myself flexibility with the colours. I had created my own colour palette and a set of materials that I applied onto the assets so they look harmonious against each other. 



## Draft Artist Statement

I love producing creative work and am passionate about bringing ideas to life through engaging and communicative solutions. I greatly value opportunities to learn, grow and evolve and believe that experiences are crucial in shaping one's creative idenity and practice. I am excited to explore more of the expansive realms of digital video and web design moving forward.

## Inspirations

[Joonas Sandell's](https://joonassandell.com/) landing page has a layout I can see working for my single-page portfolio. I like how all the elements move as I scroll, and the layering of 2D graphic elements, typography and images is very interesting. The style is bold and creative and I think it'll be cool to put own spin on it.

While making my second portfolio site earlier this year, I chanced upon [Angello Torres's](https://angellotorres.com/) webpage and was blown away. Although my portfolio ended up not looking anything like theirs, I really admire the bold play of colours and typography that somehow exists in harmony with each other and expresses the designer's unique style and creative persona. I aspire to create an experimentive and aesthetic look that's at least half as good as this one.
