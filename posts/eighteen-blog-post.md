# :page_with_curl: Week 10 Session 2 Homework - Assignment 4 Start

The key words I want to be associated with the aesthetic of my webpage, and that I think reflects the style of my works well are: <b>pop, imaginative and colourful.</b>

I love producing creative work and am passionate about bringing ideas to life through engaging and communicative solutions.

[Joonas Sandell's](https://joonassandell.com/) landing page has a layout I can see working for my single-page portfolio. I like how all the elements move as I scroll, and the layering of 2D graphic elements, typography and images is very interesting. The style is bold and creative and I think it'll be cool to put own spin on it.

While making my second portfolio site earlier this year, I chanced upon [Angello Torres's](https://angellotorres.com/) webpage and was blown away. Although my portfolio ended up not looking anything like theirs, I really admire the bold play of colours and typography that somehow exists in harmony with each other and expresses the designer's unique style and creative persona. I aspire to create an experimentive and aesthetic look that's at least half as good as this one.
