# :detective: Studio 1 Scavenger Hunt 
My Scavenging Team‚Ñ¢Ô∏è consisted of 5 members: Jacqueline, Jill, Lachy, Ruby, and me. 

## 1 - An explosive cup of coffee.

After we made our quick introductions, we hurried out with the other teams, eager to begin the hunt. We decided to start working on the checklist from the first item: 'An explosive cup of coffee.' Although we could not quite decrypt what 'explosive' meant, I suggested we go to the closest cafe from our starting point, Bowen St. Cafe. We decided to take our first photo here, and be on the lookout for another cafes that might better suit the description as we continued our hunt.

## 2 - A book containing Digital Media wisdom, found amongst many.

Perhaps the most time-consuming of all our attempts, this item led the team to the Swanston Library. Completely new to and unfamiliar with the library, we were slightly overwhelmed with where to start. Jacqueline and Jill made the astute decision to search through the library directory for books with titles including 'digital media'. We realised then that we were on the wrong floor and and went downstairs to continue the search. Althought it took us a considerable amount of time to scour through the shelves, we eventually found one of the books we saw on the directory (with a little help from the librarian), as pictured above, called 'The Poetics of Digital Media'.

## 3 - A wide net strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.

While exploring the library for the previous item, Ruby and I passed the net of paper cranes by chance and brought the rest of the team in for the photo. What luck!

## 4 - A curtain of roots, delivered by a winged visitor.

*Us on Bowen Street with the installation*

When I first saw this riddle I immediately thought of the buildings 2,4 and 6 on Bowen Street that were covered in endless vines, but could not draw the association between any of them and a 'winged visitor'. Upon seeing the installation at the front of building 8, Lachy mentioned that the way the roots covered the open staircase behind it made it appear as if it were a curtain of sorts. Although the team had lingering doubts, at that point we were almost out of time and thought this was our best shot at the riddle and took the photo here.

## 5 - A door for the condemned.

While we were walking about, trying to decipher the next riddle, Lachy had managed to search up building 11 (Old Melbourne Goal) online, and its history of holding prisoners long ago. We immediately walked over to snap a photo with the doorway.

## 6 - A study space fit for a Sith Lord.

While tackling the second riddle, Ruby brought up that she had heard the study space at Swanston Library was known by some people as the 'Star Wars Pods' due to its sci-fi-looking design. We found the space and took this photo from a distance, wary of disburbing the people studying there.


## 7 - The disembodied hands of a great ape.

When I saw 'ape hands' on the checklist, it immediately rang a bell as I remembered passing it during orietation. I brought the rest of the team over to building 4 where it was located to take the photo.

## 9 - A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.

This one was an accidental find while we were exiting the library after solving the previous riddles at the library. We thought that this unique beverage vending machine vaguely matched the description of the riddle and took a photo with the machine.


## The Unsolved - #8 and #10

Clueless and out of time, we unfortunately returned to the studio without deciphering 2 of the riddles: a basement-dwelling Black Box, bigger than you might think and a golden globe atop a tower of eights. Despite that and the hunch we may have gotten a couple of answers wrong, I still enjoyed the opportunity this activity gave me to get to know some of my classmates on my first day of university.

## Notes

As someone with experience with Premiere Pro and editing, but has not been actively using it for some time, this week's lesson and the tutorials on LinkedIn Learning have definately helped me to re-familliarise myself with the software and its tools. One of my greatest takeaways was the shortcut keys for expediting the editing process, as I was not aware that there were so many of them. I also learnt the techniques of top and tail editing, roll trimming and subclipping from the online tutorials. In the simple clip embedded above, I tried to test out and experiment with some of the new shortcut keys, to montage together 3 separate clips. The first clip and audio is courtesy to Arielle, and the other 2 clips were filmed by me. I will definately keep in mind all these tools and techniques while working on Assignment 1.

# :page_with_curl: Week 2 Session 1 Homework - Storyboard

*Storyboard in progress*

## Concept
This story is titled "Leaving The Nest". It conveys the disorientation and overwhelming emotions I felt when I first moved to Melbourne, moving away from the comfort of my home and family for the first time. It explores the initial feelings of fear and isolation, to melancholy and sadness of being homesick, and finally contentment and calmness from adjusting to the move. cont.

## Establishing and Maintaining Continuity

There are a few shots I intend to sequence with visual continuity. In shot 3 of the storyboard, I will be sequencing a series of long shots that were filmed moving in an anti-clockwise direction and overlaying them with shots of the cityscape. The rotating footage was filmed to show disorientation and confusion.

In shot 13 of the storyboard, to connect the previous frame of the 2 seagulls in the frame to the following frame of Princes Walk at sunset, 2 long shots - one shot in daytime at the gardens, and the another at Princes Walk at sunset, that share the visual similarity of hacving strong leading lines with subject moving towards the centre will help establish contuity and make the transition between the 2 times of day more seamless.
