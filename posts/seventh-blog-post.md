## Classroom Task

*20 thumbnail sketches*

The task was to create 20 thumbnail sketches of a chosen topic- I chose my home country, Singapore. Most of the icons are of the cityscape, the food, icons and landmarks. I think the most effective sketches were 3-the national flag, number 11-of the Marina Bay Sands skyline and garden domes, number 18 of the national mascot the Merlion, as well as number 19 of the country geographic outline.

## Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches

For my icons with 'home' as the theme, I will be using symbolic representations of the ideas I am working with. I have identified that I will be making icons of the following: security, size, neighbourhood, location, community, appreciation value, lifestyle, amenities, construction & renovation.

As these are the early thumbnail sketches, the final designs might differ marginally. I will pinpoint which icons I like at this point in time. 

- For 'security' I would choose 3, and create shadows to make it more dimensional and rotate it to make the design look more dynamic. Through the use of colour contrast, I will draw attention to the house detail in the lock.

- For 'size', I would go for 4. I think it brings the point across better than the other options. The leading lines also create an interesting dynamic. I will also position this icon in the centre of the 9 icons, as I think the lines will draw the viewers' attention to the centre first, then to the other icons that they are pointing towards. As the arrows will overlap with the house element , I will create colour contrast by making the arrows much lighter than the house and the background.

- For 'neighbourhood', I would choose 3. To be honest, I did try out most of the sketches in the set on Ilustrator, and the best design ended up being what seemed like a hybrid of several of them. But I think it still looks the most similar to 3. This design had many details, and I had to carefully choose my colours to make the design look uncomplicated yet dimensional. I used white for the directional arrows and centre house front, to create contrast and emphasis.

- For 'location' I would choose 1. During the design process, I thought it would be nice to add a house inside the map, but it ended up looking too complicated, as such, I might just add the house into the interaction icon. I wanted to give some dimension to the map without removing the contrast between the it with the pin and the background, so I usde low contrast monochromatic colours to add the detail.

- For 'community' I would choose 2. To create contrast, I would make the houe and person on the left larger than the right, and use colour to make it stand out more as the key focal point. I will also add a text bubble as an additional detail.

- For 'appreciation value' I would choose 1, as I think it is the most straightforward of all the options. But I might add a house to the design as I wanted the icon to reflect appreciation value more than price, and also try my best to emphasise this in the interaction icon. 

- For 'lifestyle', I would mix 1 and 5 which both features cars. I linked the garage element of 1, and the parking sign of 2. In order to make the car more three-dimensional to compliment the other icons, I decided on a angled side view/ isometric of the car, instad of what I initially drew.

- For 'amenities' I had a lot of trouble deciding as I thought all the options were equally valid, but decided on 2 in the end, since a sofa and lamp instantly draws connection to the living room, one of the most comforting spaces in a home. And the provision of amenities is about providing convenience and comfort, so it became the best option. I would also use an isometric angle for the sofa to make it consistent with the rest of the icons, which mostly have an isometric key element. I will also add a window detail with low contrast in the background as a detail.

- For 'construction & renovation' I would mix 3,4 and 5. I like the idea of the blueprint with the tools around it. I will probably make tools brighter to create contrast between them and the blueprint in the background. And the original sketch 3 could possibly be the interaction icon instead.

## Inspirations

As of right now, these are my main art direction references. I love the use of strong colour schemes, that helps to separate elements within the icon from each other, so the use of outlines would not be neccessary. For the colour scheme, akin to the references, I will select 3/4 distict colours to achieve the same effect. I also like the rounded edges of the references, which I would emulate in my own icons to express friendliness and approachability.
