*20 thumbnail sketches*

The task was to create 20 thumbnail sketches of a chosen topic- I chose my home country, SIngapore. Most of the icons are of the cityscape, the food, icons and landmarks.

## Assignment 2 Chosen Concept

The theme I have chosen is 'home'.



## Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches

similar/ example/ symbolic/ arbitary?

Upload these sketches to your blog, and evaluate your work with a post that identifies and comments on the thumbnail sketches that you think are the best for each icon. Justify these choices by commenting on how you applied the elements of design in each case.
