## Classroom Task

*20 thumbnail sketches*

The task was to create 20 thumbnail sketches of a chosen topic- I chose my home country, SIngapore. Most of the icons are of the cityscape, the food, icons and landmarks.


## Assignment 2 Thumbnail Sketches

For my icons with 'home' as the theme, I will be using symbolic representations of the ideas I am working with. I have identified that I will be making icons of the following: security, size, neighbourhood, location, community, appreciation value, lifestyle, amenities, construction & renovation.

As these are the early thumbnail sketches, the final designs might differ marginally. I will pinpoint which icons I like at this point in time. 

For 'security' I would choose 3 or 5.

For 'size', I would go for 4. I think it brings the point across better than the other options. And the leading lines could look interesting.

For 'neighbourhood', I would choose 3 or 5. For 3, one big and one small house could give great contrast, but 5 has a mix of vertical ad horizontal lines that could provide visual interest.

For 'location' I would choose 1 or 5. Both feature maps, and the '3d' look of the map can provide a sense of depth in a flat design.

For 'community' I would choose 1. I think the whitespace between the two hands could be made to look like house.

For 'appreciation value' I would choose 1 or 5, I like the mix of elements of 1, but also the simplicity of 2.

For 'lifestyle', I would pick 5, but also include elements from the other options, to bring the point across better.

For 'amenities' and 'construction & renovation' I am still pretty undecided because all the ideas have merit, but I would definately try to harmony some of them into one icon, and also see how it can fit in with the rest of the suite.


## Inspirations

As of right now, these are my main art direction references. I love the use of strong colour schemes, that helps to separate elements within the icon from each other, so the use of outlines would not be neccessary. For the colour scheme, akin to the references, I will select 3/4 distict colours to achieve the same effect. I also like the rounded edges of the references, which I would emulate in my own icons to express friendliness and approachability.
