# :page_with_curl: Assignment 4 Progress

I knew that I wanted to insert some stroke vector graphics as a visual element to amplify each part of the artist biography, and decided to go for a pixel art look for these graphics as I thought they would complement the font and colours I was using. I knew from using Figma previously that there is a community page where designers and engineers can upload resources that are free to use, and I managed to find [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1196864707579677521) Figma file that provided free pixel icons. I liked this set of icons because they included the icons I had in mind, like the pencil, lightbulb and video, and they also had just the right amount of deatil.

I also went through the design to make sure there were no text widows. (In typesetting, widows and orphans are single lines of text from a paragraph that dangle at either the beginning or end of a block of text.)

## Animation Workflow

Using [this](https://youtu.be/pIF_zIDaZ94?si=bO1yMGRKNl2lWRLr) tutorial, I learnt how to do 'scroll' animations in Figma prototype. Due to Figma not supporting actual scroll animations, how this imitation effect is achieved is through making each section an indivdual component, then through making variants of these components, adding a mouse over interaction and applying the smart animation effect. I did face a fair share of issues when i first started the animations, and was very worried I could not complete all the animations I had in mind on time. Thankfully, I managed to troubleshoot these issues and becae more meticulous in executing the steps so that the animation would work smoothly. I did all the animations on a duplicate of the original frame, so that I still could constantly reference the design and layout while creating the animations in a separate frame. Being able to compare them side by side was also extremely useful for spotting inaccuracies.

## Creating Mobile Layout

I copied the original design without animations into a separate page in the same file. The reason for this was because at the time, I needed to prioritise creating the mobile layout over completing the animations. In addition, duplicating over the animations could make it much harder to adapt the design to a mobile layout. Using [this](https://youtu.be/gwiX0oASlEw?si=-4t915w5MgOHOIW0) tutorial on responsive layout in Figma, I started to make modifications to the layers so as to create an efficient adaptation workflow.

To start, I knew that the font sizes had to be modified, as the current size would have been too huge for a small phone screen. I also modified the margin and gutter of the column guide to one better suited for mobile layout. I did rough research on the ideals specs for these parameters.

Once I decided on the new font sizes, I made new text styles so that I would be able to efficiently change all the text sizes if need be.

## Finishing Touches

After completing the animations and mobile layout, I started to think about what other details were required for the site, such as
