# :page_with_curl: Assignment 4 Progress

I knew that I wanted to insert some stroke vector graphics as a visual element to amplify each part of the artist biography, and decided to go for a pixel art look for these graphics as I thought they would complement the font and colours I was using. I knew from using Figma previously that there is a community page where designers and engineers can upload resources that are free to use, and I managed to find [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1196864707579677521) Figma file that provided free pixel icons.
