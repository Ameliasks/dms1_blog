*Storyboard in progress*

## Concept
This story is titled "Leaving The Nest". It conveys the disorientation and overwhelming emotions I felt when I first moved to Melbourne, moving away from the comfort of my home and family for the first time. It explores the initial feelings of fear and isolation, to melancholy and sadness of being homesick, and finally the feelings of contentment and anticipation for a new begining.

"And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of new beginnings." is a quote by Meister Eckhart, a German Catholic theologian, philosopher and mystic. I included this quote because I think it reflects the message of the video perfectly.

## Establishing and Maintaining Continuity

There are a few shots I intend to sequence to establish visual continuity. In shot 3 of the storyboard, I will be sequencing a series of long shots that were filmed moving in an anti-clockwise direction and overlaying them with shots of the cityscape. The rotating footage was filmed to show disorientation and confusion.

In shot 13 of the storyboard, to connect the previous frame of the 2 seagulls in the frame to the following frame of Princes Walk at sunset, 2 long shots - one shot in daytime at the gardens, and the another at Princes Walk at sunset, that share the visual similarity of having strong leading lines with subjects moving towards the centre will help establish continuity and make the transition between the 2 locations in different times of day more seamless.
