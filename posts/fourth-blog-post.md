## Premiere Pro 2022 - 2024 Essential Training Chapter 6

For this exercise, I stitched 3 clips that I took for assignment 1 to the rhythm of a bright jazz audio I am considering to use for the project. I used the keyframing audio technique to ease in the ambient sound and the soundtrack at the start of the clip, as well as used it to eccentuate the ending beat of the soundtrack, so that the ending would be more impactful. I also used a constant power crossfade for the 3 ambient sounds, to ensure a smooth and consistent audio. 


## The Key Moment

One of the most important moments in the video is when the dire mood transitions into an uplifting one, between frames 10-12 on the storyboard. This transition is meant to depict a natural shift in emotion, the success of this transition relies very heavily on the execution of the sound design. In frame 10, the slow and melacholic track will fade off, giving into almost complete silence in the opening of frame 11. This will interupt the volitional attention of the audience. The sound effect of the seagulls will be added in this frame, to provide context for frame 12, with the seagulls, making use of reactive attention. After letting the quiet atmosphere simmer, it will be then where the soft, uplifting music will join the mix, transitioning their attention back into a volitional one, all the way to the end of the story. This mix of non-diegetic sound and diegetic sound is what I hope will help the audience feel the shift in the story. 

## Discussion and Analysis

The emotional tone of the video shifts several times. To immerse the audience in the disorientation of the first act, the music will be uptempo and slightly unsettling, couple with loud sound effects, to make the audio visual experience very overwhelming. In the second act, to convey the melancholy the music supporting the scenes will be gentle and somber, and the atmospheric sound will be more subdued as compared to the first act. And finally in the third act, to show contentment, the music will be soft and uplifting.
