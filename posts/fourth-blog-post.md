## Premiere Pro 2022 - 2024 Essential Training Chapter 6

For this exercise, I stitched 3 clips that I took for assignment 1 to the rhythm of a bright jazz audio I am considering to use for the project. I used the keyframing audio technique to ease in the ambient sound and the soundtrack at the start of the clip, as well as used it to eccentuate the ending beat of the soundtrack, so that the ending would be more impactful. I also used a constant power crossfade for the 3 ambient sounds, to ensure a smooth and consistent audio.

## The Key Moment

One of the most important moments in the video is when the dire mood transitions into an uplifting one, between frames 10-12 on the storyboard. This transition is meant to depict a natural shift in emotion, the success of this transition relies very heavily on the execution of the sound design. In frame 10, the slow and melacholic track will fade off, giving into almost complete silence in the opening of frame 11. This will interupt the volitional attention of the audience. The sound effect of the seagulls will be added in this frame, to provide context for frame 12, with the seagulls, making use of reactive attention. After establishing the peaceful atmosphere of the ending, it will be then where the soft, uplifting music will join the mix, transitioning their attention back into a volitional one, all the way to the end of the story. 
 

## Discussion and Analysis

Given that all the shots could be very versatile without audio, I knew the importance of reinforcing my creative intention with the proper soundtracks, so that viewers can immerse themselves into the story.

The emotional tone of the video shifts several times. To immerse the audience in the disorientation of the first act, the music will be uptempo and slightly unsettling, couple with loud sound effects, to make the audio visual experience very overwhelming. In the second act, to convey the melancholy the music supporting the scenes will be gentle and somber, and the atmospheric sound will be more subdued as compared to the first act. And finally in the third act, to show contentment, the music will be soft and uplifting. Some additional techniques that I will be using in the editing would be crossfading the ambient sounds so as to ensure a smooth audio visual experience. The only time there will be an exception is from frames 3-4, because the intention is to build up tension using fast cuts of the city, I thought it would be fitting for all the audio to sound abruptly cut off to emphasise the effect.

## Other Editing Choices

The seagull in this video is sort of a symbolisation of me, thus I draw a lot of attention to the creature at 3 important points of the video: the long establishing shot of a wondering seagull, the shot of 2 seagulls that cues in the final soundtrack after a few beats of silence, and the long ending shot of it flying away. These shots represent being lost in a new city, making friends and the excitement for a new beginning respectively.

I knew that randomly cutting songs to soundtracks that fit the mood would not be enough to execute my story. As such I allocated a time of day to each act, so that viewers will be able to visually follow the story better. Act 1 in the busy daytime, act 2 in the deep of the night that leaves room for contemplation and melacholy and act 3 at sunset where the lights from the buildings and the sun create a beautiful mix of warm and cool hues, making the shots look hopeful and peaceful.
