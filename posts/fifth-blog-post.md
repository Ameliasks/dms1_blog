## Classroom Activity - Filming and Implementing Audio

For this activity, I decided to reinforce the creative intention of the group that shot the video, by implementing a horror soundtrack and a monster gurggling sound at the end of the clip, to make it seem as if the protagonist was being watch, and is trembling with fear.

## Video Draft Process

I worked in sections for the editing, as all 3 acts of my video have very different pacing and sound design. I first arranged the clips that I know go together according to the storyboard, then time them using the beat and melody of the sondtrack as a guide. I then adjust the audio levels of the soundtrack and the ambient sounds, based on what sound is more important in conveying the narrative of the story. I then added additional sound effects I sourced online, like the telephone ringing and car honking.
