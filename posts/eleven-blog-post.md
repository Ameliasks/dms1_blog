*In class progress*

Using the icons I have prepared so far, I included the hover-image change, and on-click-audio play interactivity. Definately ran into several problems with the code, usually because of some little mistakes, whether it's directory or spelling errors. But there were also several issues will layout that could not be troubleshooted, so I backtracked until it was working normally and restarted the code. But through this process, I at least managed to takeaway some useful shortcuts that would expedite my workflow.

For the layout, I started by placing 'size' in the centre, a decision I made very early on. Then using the background colours, I carefully arranged the rest of the icons around the centre to find the most visually balanced arrangement.

Now that I can see the overview of the icons, I can see some things that can be improved, such as the visual connection between the image changes. I will refine the shapes and colours to ameliorate this. I also now have a better idea of what audio to use for the individual icons to enhance the message of each icon.

## Refinement

*Checking alignment using guides in Illustrator*

After the main designs were completed, it was time to double check all the alignments, sizes, widths and colours were unified. I used 1 or 2 of the icons as a base for the guides, then align the assets of the other icons to those guides. Especially with the image swap, I needed to make sure the elements that were supposed to be consistent inbetween swaps were accurate, ie the supporting circular motif of the top left icon, the size and postion of the rounded rectangle motif of the bottom right icon, and many other smaller details. Some minor colour changes were needed as well, for the set to look good as a whole.

I encountered some trouble regarding the alignment of the icons, since I had reduced the sizes of the icons slightly from the template for a more pleasant viewing experience. But due to this, the horizontal and vertical alignments were off. I manually adjusted the row width to fix the horizontal alignment, and used linebreak to fix the vertical alignment. 

## Sound Effects

For 'community', I thought a text notification sound would be suitable as there is a text bubble in the icon design, and it signifies communication within a community.

For 'appreciation value' since it has an association to currency, I thought a video game coin collect sound effect would be fitting.

For 'security' I wanted a negative interface sound, because usually in UI, we only come across this sound when something is being restricted or protected, and it reflects the lock and shield icons well. I added a normalise effect, added reverb, and pitched it down slightly to make the original audio sound more 'negative'.

For 'neighbourhood' I thought it would be appropriate to use a door bell sound effect since the icon features house facades.

For 'size', since my icon has arrows pointing outwards, I wanted a sound that feels like something is growing or being expanded. For this I used a bright piano sound and added reverb to make the sound fuller.

For 'location', I wanted to use a sound reminiscent of a GPS notification since it's closely affiliated with map icons. I added a bit of reverb to get more resonance from the original sound.

For 'construction', since the key asset in the icon is the hammer, I thought that it would be best to include a hammer sound effect. The recording I made of a piano key seemed to sound like a hammer hitting metal and sounds a lot brighter and fuller than any other hammer sound effect I could look up online, ergo, I decided that it was the most suitable.

For 'amenities' I wanted a calm and bright sound to reflect the comfort of having amenities in a home. I chose an elegant piano sound effect for this. The original sound had 3 notes, but I cropped it to 2 to make it a more appropriate length as an icon sound, and added the normalise effect.

For 'lifestyle' I used a car ignition sound to highlight the car in the icon. I added the normalise effect and pitched it up a notch to make the sound more bright and clean.

To ensure the consistency of volume between all the sound effects, I used the levels bar on the right side of the Audition interface as a reference to adjust the volumes of the sounds and make sure they are about the same volume.

## Overall reflection
This first foray into coding was a quite the journey, and definately a step up from making the blog. I faced many troubles on several fronts, either due to careless mistakes or unexpected coding behaviours. At least after all that troubleshooting and fixing, I've gained a deeper understanding of how html and css works. I guess you really learn the most from your mistakes! And I am estatic to be able to see my designs presented exactly the way I wanted in the end.
