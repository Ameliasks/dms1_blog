Using the icons I have prepared so far, I included the hover-image change, and on-click-audio play interactivity. Definately ran into several problems with the code, usually because of some little mistakes, whether it's directory or spelling errors. But there were also several issues will layout that could not be troubleshooted, so I backtracked until it was working normally and restarted the code. But through this process, I at least managed to takeaway some useful shortcuts that would expedite my workflow.

Now that I can see the overview of the icons, I can see some things that can be improved, such as the visual connection between the image changes. I will refine the shapes and colours to ameliorate this. I also now have a better idea of what audio to use for the individual icons to enhance the message of each icon.


Audio Notes:

For 'lifestyle' I used a car ignition sound to highlight the car in the icon. I added the normalise effect and pitched it up a notch to make the sound more bright and clean.

For 'size', since my icon has arrows pointing outwards, I wanted a sound that is light, that feels like something is being expanded, so I used this bright piano sound, and added a reverb effect to make the sound 'fuller'.

For 'security' I wanted a negative interface sound, because usually in UI, we only come across this sound when something is being restricted or protected, and it reflects the lock and shield icons well.


For 'location', I wanted to use a sound reminiscent of a GPS notification since it's closely affiliated with map icons. I added a bit of reverb to get more resonance from the original sound.
