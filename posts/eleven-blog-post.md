*In class progress*

Using the icons I have prepared so far, I included the hover-image change, and on-click-audio play interactivity. Definately ran into several problems with the code, usually because of some little mistakes, whether it's directory or spelling errors. But there were also several issues will layout that could not be troubleshooted, so I backtracked until it was working normally and restarted the code. But through this process, I at least managed to takeaway some useful shortcuts that would expedite my workflow.

Now that I can see the overview of the icons, I can see some things that can be improved, such as the visual connection between the image changes. I will refine the shapes and colours to ameliorate this. I also now have a better idea of what audio to use for the individual icons to enhance the message of each icon.

*Editing sound effects in Audition*


## Sound Effects

For 'community' I wanted to use a joyful 'level up' sound effect to reflect the idea of gaining community in the icon.

For 'size', since my icon has arrows pointing outwards, I wanted a 'pop' sound, that feels like something is being expanded, so I used this bright piano sound, and added a reverb effect to make the sound 'fuller'.

For 'appreciation value' since it has an association to currency, I thought a video game coin collect sound effect would be fitting.

For 'security' I wanted a negative interface sound, because usually in UI, we only come across this sound when something is being restricted or protected, and it reflects the lock and shield icons well. I added a normalise effect, added reverb, and pitched it down slightly to make the original audio sound more 'negative'.

For 'neighbourhood' I thought it would be appropraite to use a door bell sound effect since the icon features house facades.

For 'location', I wanted to use a sound reminiscent of a GPS notification since it's closely affiliated with map icons. I added a bit of reverb to get more resonance from the original sound.

For 'amenities' I wanted a calm and bright sound to reflect the comfort of having amenities in a home. I chose an elegant piano sound effect for this. The original sound had 3 notes, but I cropped it to 2 to make it a more appropraite length as an icon sound, and added the normalise effect.

For 'lifestyle' I used a car ignition sound to highlight the car in the icon. I added the normalise effect and pitched it up a notch to make the sound more bright and clean.

To ensure the consistency of volume between all the sound effects, I used the levels bar on the right side of the Audition interface as a base to adjust the volumes of the sounds and make sure they are about the same volume.
